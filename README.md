# JS OOP
+ refers to using self-contained pieces of code to develop applications.
+ Building applications with objects allows us to adopt some valuable techniques, namely,
	- Inheritance (objects can inherit features from other objects),
		+ refers to an object being able to inherit methods and properties from a parent object
	- Polymorphism (objects can share the same interface—how they are accessed and used—while their underlying
		implementation of the interface may differ), and
	- Encapsulation (each object is responsible for specific tasks).
		+ objects can encapsulate functionalities and inherit methods and properties from other objects
		+ refers to enclosing all the functionalities of an object within that object so that the object’s internal
			workings (its methods and properties) are hidden from the rest of the application
		+ if I want to create a simple object I can do it `const Obj = {}`,
		+ if I want to create multiple objects with same methods and properties I encapsulate it in a constructor Function
